## **AI-Powered Digital Twin for Energy Planning: Detailed UI/UX & Data Visualization Guide for Designers**

This document provides a detailed UI structure, UX flow, placeholder data examples, and visualization guidance for each step of the Digital Twin platform. It is intended to help UI designers with no prior domain knowledge to create mockups and prototypes.

**Overall Platform Principles:**

* **Clarity & Simplicity:** Assume the user is a planner, not necessarily a data scientist. Avoid jargon where possible, or provide tooltips.  
* **Visual First:** Prioritize maps, charts, and dashboards to convey information.  
* **Guided Workflow:** The UI should naturally guide the user through the planning steps.  
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure the design adapts well to typical desktop screen sizes.

### **1\. Home Screen**

    * The overall UI theme/color scheme subtly changes (e.g., accent colors, background highlights change to green/earth tones). No change in workflow or available options for now.  
  * Clicking Start New Planning Project: Takes the user to the "District Selection" page. The system is ready for a new planning session.  
  * Clicking Load Existing Project:  
    * **UI Change:** A modal window appears titled "Load Project."  
    * **Fake Data for Modal:** A list of 2-3 fake project names:  
      * "North District \- 2040 Electrification Plan" (Last Saved: 2 days ago)

    * **Modal Elements:** Each project has an "Open" button and a "Delete" icon. A "Cancel" button is also present.  
    * **Interaction:** Clicking "Open" on a project loads its data and takes the user to the relevant stage (e.g., "Scenario Comparison Dashboard" if it's a completed plan, or "Intervention Selection" if it's a work-in-progress).  
  * Clicking What is a Digital Twin?:  
    * **UI Change:** A modal info box appears titled "What is a Digital Twin?"  
    * **Fake Data for Modal (Bullet points):**  
      * A Digital Twin is a virtual replica of a physical asset, process, or system.  
      * It uses real-world data to simulate, predict, and optimize performance.  
      * In energy planning, it helps test 'what-if' scenarios for districts without real-world risk.  
      * Enables data-driven decisions for retrofits, renewable integration, and grid upgrades.  
      * Fosters collaboration between different stakeholders.  
    * **Modal Elements:** "Close" button.

  * User selects "Most Energy Intensive" buildings, 50% for this phase, "Deep Energy Retrofit," target year 2028\. Clicks Add This Retrofit Phase to Plan. The intervention appears in Column 3's summary. The "Running Total Feasibility Check" updates.  
  * User then clicks "Solar PV \+" in Column 1\. Column 2 changes to Solar PV settings. User defines a PV deployment.  
  * If an intervention definition causes a feasibility constraint (e.g., annual budget) to be exceeded, the "Running Total Feasibility Check" text might turn red, and a warning icon appears next to the problematic phase in the summary.  
  * Clicking Save Full Plan & Proceed to Simulation: System saves the entire phased intervention plan. Navigates to "Run Demand & Generation Simulations."

### **8\. Knowledge Graph (KG) Integration & Processing Module**

* **Page Title:** "Knowledge Graph Management: \[Selected District Name\]"  
* **Conceptual Overview:** This page represents the (largely automated) backend process of KG creation and updating. It's less about direct user manipulation of the KG and more about transparency into its status and the data it integrates.  
* **What the User Sees:**  
  * **Section 1: KG Status & Summary:**  
    * **Card 1: "KG Status":** "\[Green Dot\] Operational & Up-to-Date" or "\[Yellow Dot\] Synchronizing..." or "\[Red Dot\] Error \- Stale Data"

      * "Real-time Sensor Feeds (Optional)": \[Stream Icon\] IoT Platform \- \[Yellow Dash\] Active / Partially Integrated  
    * **Processing Steps (Center \- stylized boxes with arrows):**  
      * \[Box: Data Cleaning & Validation\] \-\> \[Box: Semantic Mapping (Ontology Alignment)\] \-\> \[Box: RDF Triple Generation\] \-\> \[Box: KG Population/Update\]  
      * Each box could have a sub-text like "Processed 1234 building entities" or "Generated 50000 triples."  
    * **Output (Right Side):**  
      * \[Large Icon: Knowledge Graph Symbol\] \- "District KG for 'Northwood'"  
      * \[Link: View KG Schema/Ontology\] (Opens a diagram or text definition of the ontology used ‚Äì for expert users).

* **Buttons & Interactive Elements:**  
  * \[Button: Force Re-sync All Data Sources\] (Admin/Expert feature, with confirmation).  
  * \[Button: View Data Source Details\] (Next to each input source, opens modal with path/API info, last sync details).  
  * \[Button: View KG Query Interface\] (Navigates to an expert SPARQL endpoint or simplified query builder ‚Äì advanced feature, could be hidden for general users).  
* **Happenings (User Interactions):**  
  * This page is primarily informational. The user observes the status of the KG.  
  * An expert user might click Force Re-sync if they suspect data is stale.  
  * The visualization of the pipeline gives confidence that raw and generated data are being correctly processed and integrated into the KG, which then powers other modules like GNN and RL. The "UBEM Simulation Output" being an input shows how scenario results feed back into the holistic model.
